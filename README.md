<h1 align = "center" > Ebook-Management- </h1>
Welcome to our new web application designed for educational institutions and libraries! Our
platform provides an efficient and user-friendly system for managing library books and
resources. The web app has two types of logins, one for the admin and the other for the students.<br>
The admin login provides full access to the system and allows for the management of the
library's resources, including the addition of new books, updating book information, and
removing books from the system. The admin can also view a list of all registered students and
their borrowing history.<br>
The student login, on the other hand, allows students to view the available books in the library
and borrow them. Students can also view their borrowing history and return the books they have
borrowed. The student registration feature allows new students to create an account and gain
access to the library's resources.
Our web application is designed with a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for both the
admin and the students to navigate and use. With our efficient system, the borrowing and
returning of books are hassle-free and straightforward. We believe that our web application will
help institutions manage their library resources effectively and efficiently, while also providing a
user-friendly experience for their students.
